# Run.it

A Chrome extension that lets you run local terminal commands on your local Linux / MacOS machine directly from the browser.

## Why do I need it? :confused:

Here are some possible cases where the extension immensely accelerates working with the [shell](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-what-is-shell.htm):

- Installing `npm` or Python libraries from a documentation website
- Setting up a Linux installation _(especially Arch!)_
- Fixing a bug in Linux _(maybe the Wi-Fi wasn't working and you need a `board.bin`?)_

## I want it! :wrench:

_Coming soon to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore)!_

As of now, head over to [releases](https://github.com/theGeekyLad/run.it-extension/releases) and install the latest you can find _(and maybe ... pin it?)_.

## What's in it? :gem:

Here's what you can do with the extension:

- Open [a website] that contains some commands(https://askubuntu.com/a/429950/959312)
- Use the mouse to select a command
- Right-click and select _Run command_
- Wait for a success notification!
- Click the extension icon in the Chrome extension bar (or `Alt+X`)
- See the output and be zen!
